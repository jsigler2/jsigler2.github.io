                        <p>Hi! My name is Jenna and welcome to my student portfolio. A little about me... I grew up here in San Diego and graduated from Poway High in 2007. From there I went on to California State Polytechnic University San Luis Obispo, also known as Cal Poly SLO. I started as a history major and quickly realized my only options with a history degree were grad school or to go into teaching. So I quickly changed my major to graphic communications. I will always be a lover of history though, my apartment is full of historical biographies and fossils. I'm a Lara Croft/Indiana Jones wannabe. Anywho... I digress... After I graduated from Cal Poly in 2011 with a B.S. in graphic communications, I came back to San Diego to live with my parents and work multiple jobs for free to gain experience. After I realized that I was too comfortable living with my parents I moved to a cute house in bankers hill with two other roommates. Many living situations later and I currently reside in University Heights and love every bit of it!</p>
